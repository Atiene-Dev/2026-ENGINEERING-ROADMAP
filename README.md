2026: From Transition to Lead Engineer
Status: Initializing... Current Focus: Python Fundamentals & GitHub Workflow

Goals for Q1:
Master Python automation scripts.

Build 3 security-focused tools.

Achieve 100% consistency on the contribution graph.
## 🛠️ Security Tools Lab
### 1. SMB Vulnerability Shield (shield.py) * **Purpose:** Scans the network for the SMB v1.0 protocol. * **Why:** To identify legacy systems vulnerable to EternalBlue and Ransomware attacks. * **Learning Point:** Mastered the use of Scapy to craft specific protocol queries.
### 2. Stealth SYN Scanner (stealth_scan.py) * **Purpose:** Performs a TCP "Half-Open" scan to check port status without fully connecting. * **Why:** To bypass simple logging and identify if a port is Open, Closed, or Filtered. * **Learning Point:** Debugged Npcap driver issues and analyzed TCP flags (0x12 for Open, 0x14 for Closed).
